# Mahindra-Market-Segmentation-Capstone-Project
I am extremely thrilled and looking forward for my first Capstone Project submission. I completed my course from GreyAtom, Mumbai, India.This journey has been challenging, and so far has been a roller-coaster ride. I didn't had any background of coding as I did my graduation in Mehanical Engineering, you might find my codes extremely simple and basic.The aim of this project is to identify Mahindra First Choice Services to identify various segments in the market. Also, these segmentations would allow for targeted marketing activities and sales promotions.  Kindly provide suggestions as how I can improve, Looking forward to hear from  all the amazing persons around
